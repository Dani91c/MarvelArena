I've decided to use VIPER architecture for several reasons. Some of them are:
 - Its scalability.
 - Ease of reusing code.
 - The distribution of responsibilities, which makes my code clear and easy to understand. 
 
It´s a bit complex for such a small project, buy mi idea is to expand it to take more advantage of the Marvel API.

The app uses CocoaPods as dependency manager. There are only two external libraries:
 - Alamofire. I like to use Alamofire to to simplifie networking tasks.
 - Swiftlint. I integrate swiftlint into all my projects to keep them as clean as possible.
